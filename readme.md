# Robin Hood

Robin Hood is a platform game for more sustainable development.	Integrating the disciplines of illustration, computer science and 3D modeling, the videogame tells the story of Robin Hood as it relates to Sustainable Development Goal 10, “Reduce Inequality.” The main conflict arises because of Prince John’s abuse of power, which makes the poor poorer and the rich richer, increasing inequality and injustice in his kingdom. In the guise of Robin Hood, the player acts with the goal of helping the victims of the abuse through the redistribution of wealth, therefore defeating Prince John to establish peace and equality in the world.

### 1. Download "Visual Studio Code" to your computer.

First, you will obviously need to download and install Visual Studio Code. So, connect to the official website of the program, https://code.visualstudio.com, where you will find different available versions of it. In fact, VS Code is available for both Windows and macOS.

In the case of Windows, the installer supports almost all modern systems developed by Microsoft, and it is bootable on 32-bit and 64-bit x86 and ARM architectures. To make your life easier, click on the blue button that says Windows to initiate the automatic download of the version of the file best suited for your computer.

Once the download is finished, reach into the folder containing the obtained file and double-click on its icon, to start it. At this point, click on the OK button after viewing the warning message, put a check mark on the option I accept the terms of the license agreement, and then continue with the setup by clicking on the Next buttons twice in a row. On the next screen, the program will ask you whether or not to add additional features to your experience with Visual Studio Code. Choose the settings that suit you best and confirm by clicking first on Next and then on Install to kick off the installation process.
When you have finished installing the program, uncheck the Run Visual Studio Code item and click Finish to finish. That done, I suggest you restart your computer to make the changes take effect.

As for the macOS version, on the other hand, the latter is available in three different versions: Universal (with native support for Intel and Apple Silicon processors), Intel Chips (for Macs equipped with an Intel processor), and Apple Silicon, i.e., optimized for Apple processors (e.g., M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max).As in the previous case, clicking on the blue button that says Mac will start the download of the version best suited to your system automatically.

Once the ZIP file has finished downloading, go to the downloads folder and open said file, then drag the Visual Studio Code icon to the Applications folder and you're done. On first startup, the operating system will ask you if you really want to launch an application downloaded from the Internet: confirm your decision by clicking the Open button.
