### *Rachele Tarateo*

Robin Hood is a platform game for more sustainable development.	Integrating the disciplines of illustration, computer science and 3D modeling, the videogame tells the story of Robin Hood as it relates to Sustainable Development Goal 10, “Reduce Inequality.” The main conflict arises because of Prince John’s abuse of power, which makes the poor poorer and the rich richer, increasing inequality and injustice in his kingdom. In the guise of Robin Hood, the player acts with the goal of helping the victims of the abuse through the redistribution of wealth, therefore defeating Prince John to establish peace and equality in the world.
